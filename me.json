            "abstract": "A significant phenomenon in microblogging is that certain occurrences of terms self-produce increasing mentions in the unfolding event. In contrast, other terms manifest a spike for each moment of interest, resulting in a wake-up-and-sleep dynamic. Since spike morphology and background vary widely between events, to detect spikes in microblogs is a challenge. Another way is to detect the spikiness feature rather than spikes. We present an approach which detects and aggregates spikiness contributions by combination of spike patterns, called archetypes. The soft similarity between each archetype and the time series of term occurrences is based on computational stigmergy, a bio-inspired scalar and temporal aggregation of samples. Archetypes are arranged into an architectural module called Stigmergic Receptive Field (SRF). The final spikiness indicator is computed through linear combination of SRFs, whose weights are determined with the Least Square Error minimization on a spikiness training set. The structural parameters of the SRFs are instead determined with the Differential Evolution algorithm, minimizing the error on a training set of archetypal series. Experimental studies have generated a spikiness indicator in a real-world scenario. The indicator has enhanced a cloud representation of social discussion topics, where the more spiky cloud terms are more blurred.",

The proposed RNN adopts a computational memory based on the concept of stigmergy. The basic principle of a Stigmergic Memory (SM) is that the activity of deposit/removal of a quantity in the SM stimulates the next activities of deposit/removal. Accordingly, subsequent SM activities tend to reinforce/weaken each other, generating a coherent coordination between the SM activities and the input temporal stimulus. We show that, in a problem of supervised classification, the SM encodes the temporal input in an emergent representational model, by coordinating the deposit, removal and classification activities. This study lays down a basic framework for the derivation of a SM-RNN. A formal ontology of SM is discussed, and the SM-RNN architecture is detailed. To appreciate the computational power of an SM-RNN, comparative NNs have been selected and trained to solve the MNIST handwritten digits recognition benchmark in its two variants: spatial (sequences of bitmap rows) and temporal (sequences of pen strokes).",

We propose two methods: one to avoid gradient overlapping (NOG) but keeping the same loss formulation; and one to avoid the noise injection (TE) but generating action distributions with a desired entropy. A comprehensive pilot experiment has been carried out showing how using our proposed methods speeds up the training of 210%.

The training process artificially generates extra-class samples, via image transformation and noise addition.

In this paper, the limits of both approaches are discussed. A novel hybrid training approach is developed and experimented, based on a linear combination of sparse unstructured NNs, which are joint because they share connections. Such NNs dynamically compete during the optimization, since the less important networks are iteratively pruned, until the most important network remains.

            "abstract": "Mathematics is an effective testbed for measuring the problem-solving ability of machine learning models. The current benchmark for deep learning-based solutions is grade school math problems: given a natural language description of a problem, the task is to analyse the problem, exploit heuristics generated from a very large set of solved examples, and then generate an answer. In this paper, a descendant of the third generation of Generative Pre-trained Transformer Networks (GPT-3) is used to develop a zero-shot learning approach, to solve this problem. The proposed approach shows that coding based problem-solving is more effective than the natural language reasoning based one. Specifically, the architectural solution is built upon OpenAI Codex, a descendant of GPT-3 for programming tasks, trained on public GitHub repositories, the world’s largest source code hosting service. Experimental results clearly show the potential of the approach: by exploiting the Python as programming language, proposed pipeline achieves the 18.63% solve rate against the 6.82% of GPT-3. Finally, by using a fine-tuned verifier, the correctness of the answer can be ranked at runtime, and then improved by generating a predefined number of trials. With this approach, for 10 trials and an ideal verifier, the proposed pipeline achieves 54.20% solve rate",

For this reason, a novel dataset has been annotated, selecting the most common and useful formats from hundreds of available scripts. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a general understanding and a performance study of differentimplementations of object detectors applied to this domain. A fine-tuning of deep neural networks, such as Faster R-CNN and YOLO, has been made to identify text sections of interest via bounding boxes, and to classify them into a specific pre-defined category.

SHM aims to detect and identify any deviation from a reference condition, typically a damage-free baseline, to keep track of the relevant structural integrity. Machine Learning (ML) techniques have recently been employed to empower vibration-based SHM systems. Supervised ML tends to achieve better accuracy than unsupervised ML, but it requires human intervention to label data appropriately. However, labelled data related to damage conditions of civil structures are often unavailable. To overcome this limitation, a key solution is a digital twin relying on physics-based numerical models to simulate the structural response in terms of the and vibration recordings provided by IoT devices during the events of interest, such as wind or seismic excitations. This paper presents such comprehensive approach, here framed to address the tasks of damage localization, exploiting a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Early experimental results relevant to a pilot application involving a sample structure, show the potential of the proposed approach, as well as the reusability of the trained system in presence of varying loading scenarios.",

This paper presents a DL approach for the agnostic assessment of structural changes. The proposed approach has been experimented to the stabilizing intervention carried out in 2000-2002 on the leaning tower of Pisa (Italy). The data set is made by operational and environmental measures collected from 1993 to 2006. Both conventional and recent approaches are compared: Multiple Linear regression, LSTM and Tansformer.

Thus, for water management and mitigation of the potential hazards, it is fundamental to efficiently map areal extents of river water surface. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is one of the satellite technologies applied for hydrological studies, but it has a spatial resolution which is limited for the study of rivers. On the other side, deep learning technology exhibits a high modelling potential with low spatial resolution data. In this paper, a method based on convolutional neural networks is applied to the SAR backscatter coefficient for detecting river water surface. Our experimental study focuses on the lower reach of Mijares river (Eastern Spain), covering a period from Apr 2019 to Sept 2022. Results suggest that radar backscattering has high potential in modelling water river trends, contributing to the monitoring of the effects of climate change and impacts on related ecosystem services. To assess the effectiveness of the method, the output has been validated with the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)",

            "abstract": "Most of the applications of wireless sensor networks require the continuous coverage of a region of interest. The irregular deployment of the nodes, or their failure, could result in holes in the coverage, thus jeopardizing such requirement. Methods to recover the sensing capabilities usually demand the availability of redundant full-fledged nodes, whose relocation should heal the holes. These solutions, however, do not consider the high cost of obtaining redundant, typically complex, devices, nor that they could in turn fail. In this work, we propose a bio-inspired and emergent approach toward hole detection and healing using a swarm of resource-constrained agents with reduced sensing capabilities, whose behavior draws inspiration from the concepts underlying blood coagulation. The swarm follows three rules: activation, adhesion, and cohesion, adapted from the behavior exhibited by platelets during the human healing process. Relying only on local and relative information, the mobile agents can detect the holes border and place themselves in locally optimal positions to temporarily restore the service. To validate the algorithm, we have developed a distributed, multi-process simulator. Experimental results show that the proposed method efficiently detects and heals the holes, outperforming two state-of-the-art solutions. It also demonstrates good robustness and flexibility to agent failure.",

To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, real POS transaction traffic has been used, together with real malware traffic extracted from a collection of RAM scrapers.

            "abstract": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) using IoT sensor devices plays a crucial role in the preservation of civil structures. SHM aims at performing an accurate damage diagnosis of a structure, that consists of identifying, localizing, and quantify the condition of any significant damage, to keep track of the relevant structural integrity. Deep learning (DL) architectures have been progressively introduced to enhance vibration-based SHM analyses: supervised DL approaches are integrated into SHM systems because they can provide very detailed information about the nature of damage compared to unsupervised DL approaches. The main drawback of supervised approach is the need for human intervention to appropriately label data describing the nature of damage, considering that in the SHM context, providing labeled data requires advanced expertise and a lot of time. To overcome this limitation, a key solution is a digital twin relying on physics-based numerical models to reproduce the structural response in terms of the vibration recordings provided by the sensor devices during a specific events to be monitored. This work presents a comprehensive methodology to carry out the damage localization task by exploiting a convolutional neural network (CNN) and parametric model order reduction (MOR) techniques to reduce the computational burden associated with the construction of the dataset on which the CNN is trained. Experimental results related to a pilot application involving a sample structure, show the potential of the proposed solution and the reusability of the trained system in presence of different loading scenarios",

            "abstract": "Dense Information Retrieval (DIR) has recently gained attention due to the advances in deep learning-based word embedding. In particular, for historical languages such as Latin, a DIR task is appropriate although challenging, due to: (i) the complexity of managing searches using traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP); (ii) the availability of fewer resources with respect to modern languages; (iii) the large variation in usage among different eras. In this research, pre-trained transformer models are used as features extractors, to carry out a search on a Latin Digital Library. The system computes embeddings of sentences using state-of-the-art models, i.e., Latin BERT and LaBSE, and uses cosine distance to retrieve the most similar sentences. The paper delineates the system development and summarizes an evaluation of its performance using a quantitative metric based on expert’s per-query documents ranking. The proposed design is suitable for other historical languages. Early results show the higher potential of the LabSE model, encouraging further comparative research. To foster further development, the data and source code have been publicly released",

Methods: Prospective observational study were conducted between 1 and 30 April 2022. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) diagnosis of adenomyosis was investigated by an experienced sonographer on 100 fertile-age patients. Videoclips of the uterine corpus were recorded and sequential ultrasound images were extracted. Intermediate ultrasound- skilled trainees and DL machine were asked to make a diagnosis reviewing uterine images. We evaluated and compared the accuracy, sensitivity, positive predictive value, F1-score, specificity and negative predictive value of the DL model and the trainees for adenomyosis diagnosis. Results: Accuracy of DL and intermediate ultrasound-skilled trainees for the diagnosis of adenomyosis were 0.51 (95% CI, 0.48-0.54) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.79), respectively. Sensitivity, specificity and F1-score of DL were 0.43 (95% CI, 0.38-0.48), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79-0.85) and 0.46 (0.42-0.50), respectively, whereas intermediate ultrasound-skilled trainees had sensitivity of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.52-0.86), specificity of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.58-0.79) and F1-score of 0.55 (95% CI, 0.43-0.66). Conclusions: In this preliminary study DL model showed a lower accuracy but a higher specificity in diagnosing adenomyosis on ultrasonographic images compared to intermediate-skilled trainees",

            "abstract": "Today, globalized markets require more resilient and agile manufacturing systems, as well as customized and virtualized features. Classical self-standing manufacturing systems are evolving into collaborative networks such as Cloud Manufacturing (based on centralized knowledge and distributed resources) or Shared Manufacturing (based on fully decentralized knowledge and distributed resources) as a solution to ensure business continuity under normal as well as special circumstances. Additive Manufacturing (AM), one of the enablers of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), is a promising technology for innovative production models due to its inherent distributed capabilities, digital nature, and product customization ability. To increase the adaptivity of distributed resources using AM technology, this paper proposes a mechanism for sharing workload and resources under unexpected behaviours in the supply chain. Smart contracts and blockchain technology in this concept are used to provide decentralized, transparent, and trusted operation of such systems, which provide more resilience to disruptive factors. In this paper, the proposed Blockchain-based Shared Additive Manufacturing (BBSAM) protocol, ontology, and workflow for AM capacity pooling are discussed and analysed under special conditions such as anomalous demand. Discrete-time Python simulation on a real Italian AM market dataset, also provided, is available on GitHub.",

We propose a deep learning ensemble model to address both object detection and classification problem leveraging the strengths of individual models to achieve higher performance than single models. The proposed architecture was evaluated on a real-world dataset developed by experienced clinicians who manually labeled individual photographic images, producing a benchmark dataset. Results from our comparative analysis demonstrates the ensemble detection model achieves superior performance compared to the individual models, outperforming the average value of the individual models' map@50 metric by 24% and the value of the map@95-50 metric by 44%<",

            "abstract": "Background: Although hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy is the gold standard in the diagnosis of endometrial pathology, the gynecologist experience is crucial for a correct diagnosis. Deep learning (DL), as an artificial intelligence method, might help to overcome this limitation. Unfortunately, only preliminary findings are available, with the absence of studies evaluating the performance of DL models in identifying intrauterine lesions and the possible aid related to the inclusion of clinical factors in the model. Aim: To develop a DL model as an automated tool for detecting and classifying endometrial pathologies from hysteroscopic images. Methods: A monocentric observational retrospective cohort study was performed by reviewing clinical records, electronic databases, and stored videos of hysteroscopies from consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed intrauterine lesions at our Center from January 2021 to May 2021. Retrieved hysteroscopic images were used to build a DL model for the classification and identification of intracavitary uterine lesions with or without the aid of clinical factors. Study outcomes were DL model diagnostic metrics in the classification and identification of intracavitary uterine lesions with and without the aid of clinical factors. Results: We reviewed 1500 images from 266 patients: 186 patients had benign focal lesions, 25 benign diffuse lesions, and 55 preneoplastic/neoplastic lesions. For both the classification and identification tasks, the best performance was achieved with the aid of clinical factors, with an overall precision of 80.11%, recall of 80.11%, specificity of 90.06%, F1 score of 80.11%, and accuracy of 86.74 for the classification task, and overall detection of 85.82%, precision of 93.12%, recall of 91.63%, and an F1 score of 92.37% for the identification task. Conclusion: Our DL model achieved a low diagnostic performance in the detection and classification of intracavitary uterine lesions from hysteroscopic images. Although the best diagnostic performance was obtained with the aid of clinical data, such an improvement was slight.",

Utilizing the llama2-70b as the generator and a multilingual sentence transformer as embedder, we generate an Italian chat corpus and refine the Fauno corpus, which is based on translated English ChatGPT self-chat data. The refinement uses structural assertions and Natural Language Processing techniques. Both corpora undergo a comprehensive quality evaluation using the proposed MLM model-based quality metric.
